# ZeroEngine Render URP

Unity 6000.6 / URP 17.6 pixel-art rim lighting. `ZeroEngine.Render.Urp`
depends only on Unity and URP. Gameplay classes, actor discovery, configuration,
pooling and project assets stay in the consumer. The existing UnityEngine-only
`com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.render` package remains independent.

## Enable

1. Add `SpriteRimRendererFeature` to each URP Renderer used by the game cameras.
2. Add `SpriteRimLighting` to an actor and call `Configure(renderers, profile)`.
   A null profile keeps a clear contour with a faint inward transition over two
   art cells. The deeper artwork retains its original exposure.
3. Create a dedicated light with `GameObject > Light > 角色边缘点光` or
   `角色边缘聚光`; the Editor-only authoring assembly adds the native light and
   `SpriteRimLightSource` together, with ordinary Undo support. For an existing
   native Point/Spot, add `SpriteRimLightSource` explicitly.
   Its component checkbox enables or disables rim participation. Unmarked lights
   continue to illuminate source materials without creating an actor rim.
   URP visibility, culling masks and the camera frustum select up to four marked
   local lights per actor. Directional lights and sky illumination remain excluded.
   HDR intensity controls coverage separately from hue, preserving colored edges.

For authored 2D fields, create `SpriteRimLight` components and pass their explicit
array to `Configure(renderers, lights, profile)`. Both inputs use the same enhanced
composite. The old preview tint and reference MRT implementations are removed.

Consumers can enroll their Player/entity renderers at their normal enable and
renderer-replacement entry points. Disable the lighting component when the actor
is disabled; reconfigure when its renderer changes. Re-enabling rebuilds its owned
draws, making pooled reuse independent of the previous actor. No scene-wide actor
scan or per-frame light scan is needed.

## Rendering and ownership

The feature runs after opaque/alpha-clipped drawing. Depth prevents recoloring
occluded or dissolved pixels; transparent source materials retain their own
rendering and are skipped. Transparent overlays render normally afterward.
The system does not replace shared materials or modify source property blocks.
Its own materials/masks are released on disable or target replacement.

The mask follows Sprite pixels-per-unit, pivot, flips and world transforms.
For enlarged textures or custom/unreadable meshes, configure `SpriteRimPixelGrid`.
Art cells retain point-sampled source color; only contour coverage is filtered.
Incoming HDR/emission is preserved, and the profile controls added highlight
limits and a weak inward light wrap. This is stylized depth-aware recoloring;
it does not add normal maps or independently reproduce shadow attenuation.

Only registered actors visible to a game base camera update their silhouette.
Scene lights are captured from that camera's URP culling results. Disabling an
actor or removing its light removes its contribution in the same camera render.
No optional legacy rendering path or automatic fallback is installed.

## Validation and consumption

Run `ZeroEngine.Render.Urp.Tests.Editor` for light selection and assembly ownership,
then `ZeroEngine.Render.Urp.Tests.Runtime` for real Render Graph output, native
local lights/culling and daylight exclusion, opposed lights, light wrap, pivots, flips, scaling, occlusion,
transparent sources and restoration. Consumer actor lifecycle and real entry
remain consumer tests. No packaged Player or device performance claim is implied.

A consumer's startup or quit save hooks can run even in package-only rendering
tests. Run these PlayMode cases through that consumer's whole-Play storage scope;
keep consumer-specific save adapters outside this package.

Use the official Git UPM URL pinned to the tested commit. A local `file:` URL is
for temporary verification only. Add this package to the consumer's `testables`
list when running the package tests.
